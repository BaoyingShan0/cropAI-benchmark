# cropAI-benchmark
A crop AI benchmark platform, proving dataset and a leadboard.

The open-access dataset will include key input features such as climate variables, socioeconomic indicators, soil properties, and other relevant covariates. The output variables will be yield, yield trend, and yield anomaly. For the training and validation sets, both inputs and target variables will be accessible. For the test set, only input
features will be available, while target values will remain hidden. Researchers can submit their model predictions to receive objective scores based on standard evaluation metrics.
